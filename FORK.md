# steamdeck-ports-mgr

A fork of [Ports Launcher](https://github.com/Nyaldee/Ports-Launcher) by Nyaldee, aimed at the Steam
Deck: installing, updating and backing up native PC ports, and adding them to Steam.

Ports Launcher is licensed GPL-3.0-or-later, and so is this fork. The original copyright notices are
kept. This file is the notice of modification that GPL-3.0 section 5(a) asks for.

## How this fork differs from upstream

New features go in new files where possible, so upstream changes keep merging cleanly. Every edit
to a file that came from upstream is listed here with its date.

| Date | Upstream file | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-20 | `src/core/config.rs` | Added tests that pin how local entries with a GitHub or GitLab source load |

Files added by this fork:

| Date | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-20 | `.gitignore` | Keeps build output, game files, keys and firmware out of the repo |
| 2026-10-20 | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Builds the Linux x86_64 release and runs the tests on every push |
| 2026-10-20 | `.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml` | Daily merge of upstream changes (see below) |
| 2026-10-20 | `FORK.md` | This file |

## Staying in step with upstream

`upstream-sync.yml` runs daily and can be started by hand from the Actions tab.

1. It merges upstream `main` into an `upstream-sync` branch.
2. It runs the full CI build and tests on that branch.
3. If upstream only touched the catalog (`ports.json`, `themes.json`, `lang/`) and the tests pass,
   the merge lands on `main` directly.
4. Anything else opens or refreshes a pull request listing the upstream commits, the files changed,
   and which of those files this fork has also changed.
5. A merge conflict fails the run with the conflicting files in the run summary.

To test the workflow without touching `main`, start it by hand with `base_branch` set to a scratch
branch.

## Builds

Every push builds `steamdeck-ports-mgr-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, available as an artifact on the Actions
run. Upstream's `ports_launcher_updater.sh` is left out of this package on purpose: it downloads
upstream's release and would replace this build.
