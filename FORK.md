# steamdeck-ports-mgr

A fork of [Ports Launcher](https://github.com/Nyaldee/Ports-Launcher) by Nyaldee, aimed at the Steam
Deck: installing, updating and backing up native PC ports, and adding them to Steam.

Ports Launcher is licensed GPL-3.0-or-later, and so is this fork. The original copyright notices are
kept. This file is the notice of modification that GPL-3.0 section 5(a) asks for.

## How this fork differs from upstream

New features go in new files where possible, so upstream changes keep merging cleanly. Every edit
to a file that came from upstream is listed here with its date.

| Date | Upstream file | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-20 | `src/core/config.rs` | Added tests that pin how local entries with a GitHub or GitLab source load |
| 2026-10-20 | `src/core/version.rs` | Self-update check and project links point at this fork instead of upstream |
| 2026-10-20 | `README.md` | Note at the top crediting Nyaldee and listing what this fork adds |

Files added by this fork:

| Date | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-20 | `.gitignore` | Keeps build output, game files, keys and firmware out of the repo |
| 2026-10-20 | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Builds the Linux x86_64 release and runs the tests on every push |
| 2026-10-20 | `.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml` | Daily merge of upstream changes (see below) |
| 2026-10-20 | `FORK.md` | This file |
| 2026-10-20 | `STEAM_DECK.md` | How to install and test this fork on a Steam Deck |

## What still comes from upstream at runtime

- **The catalog.** The app downloads `ports.json` and `themes.json` from upstream's repository about
  every 12 hours (`src/core/catalog_sync.rs`), so the catalog on a device matches upstream's, not
  this repo's copy. Personal entries belong in `ports.local.json` next to the executable.
- **Self-update** now checks this fork's releases. The fork publishes no releases yet, so the app
  never offers an update. "Force update" shows an error because the updater script is not shipped.

## Staying in step with upstream

`upstream-sync.yml` runs daily on `main` and can be started by hand from the Actions tab.

1. It merges upstream `main` into an `upstream-sync` branch.
2. It runs the full CI build and tests on that branch.
3. If upstream only touched the catalog (`ports.json`, `themes.json`, `lang/`) and the tests pass,
   the merge lands on `main` directly.
4. Anything else opens or refreshes a pull request listing the upstream commits, the files changed,
   and which of those files this fork has also changed.
5. A merge conflict, or upstream history that shares nothing with this fork's, fails the run with a
   summary.

Notes:
- Opening PRs needs Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions > "Allow GitHub Actions to
  create and approve pull requests".
- Pushes and PRs made by the workflow do not trigger CI on their own. The test result is in the PR
  body and the run summary.
- While a sync PR is open and already has the newest upstream commit, the workflow leaves its
  branch alone. If upstream moves again, or no PR is open, the branch is rebuilt, so put fix-ups on
  a separate branch.
- To test without touching `main`, start it by hand with `base_branch` set to a scratch branch.

## Builds

Every push builds `steamdeck-ports-mgr-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, available as an artifact on the Actions
run. It holds the program, `7zzs`, and a starter `ports.json` and `themes.json`. Upstream's
`ports_launcher_updater.sh` is left out on purpose: it downloads upstream's release.
